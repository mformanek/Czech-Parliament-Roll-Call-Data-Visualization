3D data vizualization script to download and process data from the Czech Parliament.

Uses a 3D vizualization method developed by Keith Poole (<ktpoole@uga.edu>)  to show the voting trends in 
the Czech Parliament over the last 4 years. 

The script downloads up to date publicly available roll call data from the servers of the Czech parlament then reformats the data for
the W-nominate package. Plotly is then used to generate the final visual look of the interactive graph.  

Written entirely in R. Final output is in the form of an HTML webpage. Last tested July 2017.
